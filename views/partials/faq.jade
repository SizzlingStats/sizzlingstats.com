      | What is the difference between DPM (Damage Per Minute) and DDPM
      | (Damage Dealt Per Minute)?
    dd
      | DPM includes damage that exceeded the enemy player's health, aka 
      | "overkill" damage. For example, if you frag an enemy with 20 health,
      | but your shot's damage amount was 100, the damage dealt was 20, but
      | total damage was 100.
